# Installs an Arch Linux Desktop

This is an ansible recipe I use to rebuild my Arch desktop, so it's quite personalized, but I hope you can use it to base off and build your own.

## TODO
- [ ] The ansible pacman module seems to fail idempotency tests. I need to debug if this is a thing with one of my packages or in general with the module
- [ ] Add automated testing
