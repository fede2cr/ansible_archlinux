# Ansible module for AUR

** This module is broken **

I cannot find how to use properly sudo with makepkg. Work in progress.

Taken from https://gist.github.com/wrecker/39ecb1eb1ab8ee1d0ce1
## TODO for AUR module:
- [x] Replace "sudo" with "become"
- [ ] Dependencies asks for sudo password, so it fails
